Terraria Fortress 2 is a mod inspired by Team Fortress 2 and is intended to add at the very least all of the TF2 stock weapons.

Version 1.0 adds stock weapons for every class.
Some point within a week of this release date, I'll release 1.1 which fixes the medigun and adds actual sprites for the melee weapons.
